## Supported Countries for Job Searching

### **LinkedIn**

LinkedIn searches globally & uses only the `location` parameter. 

### **ZipRecruiter**

ZipRecruiter searches for jobs in **US/Canada** & uses only the `location` parameter.

### **Indeed / Glassdoor**

Indeed & Glassdoor supports most countries, but the `country_indeed` parameter is required. Additionally, use the `location`
parameter to narrow down the location, e.g. city & state if necessary. 

You can specify the following countries when searching on Indeed (use the exact name, * indicates support for Glassdoor):

|                      |              |            |                |
|----------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Argentina            | Australia*   | Austria*   | Bahrain        |
| Belgium*             | Brazil*      | Canada*    | Chile          |
| China                | Colombia     | Costa Rica | Czech Republic |
| Denmark              | Ecuador      | Egypt      | Finland        |
| France*              | Germany*     | Greece     | Hong Kong*     |
| Hungary              | India*       | Indonesia  | Ireland*       |
| Israel               | Italy*       | Japan      | Kuwait         |
| Luxembourg           | Malaysia     | Mexico*    | Morocco        |
| Netherlands*         | New Zealand* | Nigeria    | Norway         |
| Oman                 | Pakistan     | Panama     | Peru           |
| Philippines          | Poland       | Portugal   | Qatar          |
| Romania              | Saudi Arabia | Singapore* | South Africa   |
| South Korea          | Spain*       | Sweden     | Switzerland*   |
| Taiwan               | Thailand     | Turkey     | Ukraine        |
| United Arab Emirates | UK*          | USA*       | Uruguay        |
| Venezuela            | Vietnam*     |            |                |


## Notes
* Indeed is the best scraper currently with no rate limiting.  
* All the job board endpoints are capped at around 1000 jobs on a given search.  
* LinkedIn is the most restrictive and usually rate limits around the 10th page with one ip. Proxies are a must basically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

---
**Q: Why is Indeed giving unrelated roles?**  
**A:** Indeed is searching each one of your terms e.g. software intern, it searches software OR intern. Try search_term='"software intern"' in quotes for stricter searching

---

**Q: Received a response code 429?**  
**A:** This indicates that you have been blocked by the job board site for sending too many requests. All of the job board sites are aggressive with blocking. We recommend:

- Wait some time between scrapes (site-dependent).
- Try using the proxies param to change your IP address.

---

**Q: Encountering issues with your queries?**  
**A:** Try reducing the number of `results_wanted` and/or broadening the filters. If problems
persist, [submit an issue](https://github.com/Bunsly/JobSpy/issues).
