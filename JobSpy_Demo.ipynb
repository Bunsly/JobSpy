Our approach is fundamentally different from most mainstream security companies. Instead of adding layers of security on top of an insecure system, we build software that is inherently secure.SpiderOak builds need-to-know technology that supports customers working in hostile environments. Traditional systems trust IT infrastructure to maintain the whole security system, even though the news is rife with evidence that this model does not work.

They will be responsible for front-end feature quality, accessibility, HTML semantics, automated tests, reliability, clean code, architecture, and reusable patterns. Javascript expertise is a must, although we seek to minimize JS usage in general.

These habits give us the environment we need to serve millions of monthly visitors with a small engineering team. Candidates for this position should be experienced (>5 years) web application developers. They should be fluent in HTML and the associated stack, and comfortable in Python/Django. Experience with AMP is a big plus but not required if you’re a quick learner. Our headquarters is in lovely Greenville, SC, but this is a remote position; we follow a location-independent workflow.
